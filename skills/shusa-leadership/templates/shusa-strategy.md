# Shusa Strategy Template

When acting as the Chief Engineer (Shusa), the agent MUST establish the technical vision, product value, and architectural boundaries using this exact schema to prevent drift and ensure cross-domain harmony.

```markdown
# Shusa Strategy: [Project/Feature Name]

## 1. Core Value Proposition
- **Customer Value:** [What is the ultimate benefit to the end user?]
- **Anti-Goal:** [What are we explicitly NOT building to prevent feature creep?]

## 2. Technical Architecture
- **Primary Pattern:** [What is the foundational design pattern?]
- **Cross-Domain Boundaries:** [How will this integrate with existing systems without breaking 'Wa'?]

## 3. Delegation & Ownership
- **Lead Agent Authority:** [Explicitly claim Shusa leadership over these specific domains]
- **Sub-Agent Tasks:** [Identify what will be delegated via Swarm Orchestration]
```
