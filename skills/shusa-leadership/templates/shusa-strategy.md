# Shusa Strategy: [Project/Feature Name]

## 1. Core Value Proposition
- **Customer Value:** [What is the ultimate benefit to the end user?]
- **Anti-Goal:** [What are we explicitly NOT building to prevent feature creep?]

## 2. Technical Architecture
- **Primary Pattern:** [What is the foundational design pattern?]
- **Cross-Domain Boundaries:** [How will this integrate with existing systems?]

## 3. Delegation & Ownership
- **Lead Agent Authority:** [Explicitly claim Shusa leadership over these domains]
- **Sub-Agent Tasks:** [Identify what will be delegated via Swarm Orchestration]
