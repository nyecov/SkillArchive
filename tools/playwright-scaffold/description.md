# Playwright Scaffold

A JavaScript automation script that injects a best-practice Playwright testing environment into any web project.

**Primary Uses:**
1. Eliminating the boilerplate setup required to start end-to-end testing.
2. Generating a foundational `playwright.config.js` with multi-browser support and CI awareness.
3. Creating an initial `example.spec.js` test file demonstrating visual regression snapshots and basic assertions.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run in the root of the web project
node playwright_scaffold.js
```
